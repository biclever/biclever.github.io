**The tool offers the following features:**

- **Data Provider List Export**: Exports a list of documents along with their universes. Unlike the Central Management Console (CMC)’s “Check Relationships” feature, this tool opens documents and checks actual universes, providing more accurate results and identifying broken dependencies (e.g., missing universes).

- **Document Purging** *(Premium feature 🌟)*: Cleans up prompt values, which is useful before promoting documents to production environments.

- **Force Query Regeneration** *(Premium feature 🌟)*: Regenerates all queries in selected documents (custom queries are not regenerated).

- **Regression Testing** *(Premium feature 🌟)*: Allows you to run regression tests to ensure that changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.

- **UNV to UNX Conversion** *(Premium feature 🌟)*: Remaps documents from UNV (Universe) format to UNX format.

- **Data Source Remapping** *(Premium feature 🌟)*: Changes data sources in documents using a specified mapping.

- **CMS Query Execution**: Runs Central Management Server (CMS) queries without requiring server client tools, unlike the CMS Query Builder.
